# Chat History Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The main home page chat interface was not maintaining conversation history. Messages were being cleared whenever the user navigated away from the page and returned.

## Root Cause
In `/src/pages/app-layout/home/index.tsx`, the `useEffect` cleanup function was calling `clearMessages()`, which deleted all chat history when the component unmounted.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Auto-Clear on Unmount
- Removed `clearMessages()` from the cleanup function in the home page component
- This allows messages to persist when navigating between pages

### 2. Added Session Storage Persistence
Enhanced the `ChatProvider` component to:
- Save chat messages to `sessionStorage` whenever they change
- Load previous messages from `sessionStorage` on initial mount
- Messages persist across page refreshes within the same browser session

### 3. Added Manual Clear Button
- Added a trash icon button in the top-right corner of the chat interface
- Only appears when there are messages in the chat
- Includes a tooltip explaining its function
- Allows users to manually clear chat history when needed

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/pages/app-layout/home/index.tsx`
   - Removed `clearMessages()` from useEffect cleanup
   - Added clear chat button with tooltip

2. `/src/providers/chat-provider.tsx`
   - Added sessionStorage persistence
   - Messages are stored with key 'stak-chat-history'
   - Automatic save on message changes
   - Automatic load on component initialization

## User Experience
- ✅ Chat history now persists when navigating between pages
- ✅ Chat history persists on page refresh (within same session)
- ✅ Users can manually clear chat with the trash button
- ✅ Clean UI with the clear button only showing when needed

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Start a chat conversation on the home page
2. Navigate to another page (e.g., Explore)
3. Return to home - messages should still be visible
4. Refresh the page - messages should persist
5. Click the trash button - chat should clear
6. Close browser tab and reopen - chat should be empty (sessionStorage cleared)
